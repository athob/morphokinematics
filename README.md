# morphokinematics

Python2.7 routines for computing kinematics and morphological diagnostics of particles-made systems. These routines go with the study [Thob et al. 2018](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01954) where such measurements have been computed for simulated galaxies. Please acknowledge by citing the latter if these routines have been significant for a research project that leads to a publication. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for usage.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a working Python2.7 installation with the following libraries already installed in their proposed version:

```
numpy 1.15.4
scipy 1.1.0
```

### Installing

To use the routines, simply download and copy the main script [morphokinematicsdiagnostics.py](morphokinematicsdiagnostics.py) to your working directory. Then execute it within your python environment via the following command

```
execfile("morphokinematicsdiagnostics.py")
```
